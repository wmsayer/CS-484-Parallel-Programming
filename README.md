# CS 484 Parallel Programming
Course project written in C++ using MPI and OpenMP to parallelize the sorting of a large dataset of numbers.

My writeup for the project can be seen in this directory and my code for the project can be seen in `sortproject/src/solution.cpp` and `sortproject/src/solution.h`. The rest of the code in sortproject was provided as a template for the project.
